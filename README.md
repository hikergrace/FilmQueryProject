# Film Query Project

#### Description

This is a command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It is menu-based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data. You can look up a film by ID or a search keyword (or partial keyword). 

When you start the FilmQuery.app, you are presented with three options. You may look up a film by it's ID or by a search keyword. You may continue to search until you choose to exit the program. Choosing either ID or keyword allows you to see a film's title, rating, a brief description, the cast (if present), and the primary language. 

#### Deliverables: 
1. User can look up a film by ID
2. User can look up a film by keyword
3. Title, description, rating, year, cast, and language are displayed

#### Technologies

Object-oriented Java with classes for film, actor, language, database accessor, and database accessor object, and an app that contains MAIN. 

Then DababaseAccessorObject.java contains the methods to get films by various search queries. These queries are driven by a SQL query tied to a film database. 

#### Lessons learned

It's interesting seeing several pieces come together. I definitely am gaining a better understanding of objects and classes. The SQL queries were a big stumbling block, particularly dealing with joins.
